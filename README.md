# The timing of Censorship

This study analyses the content of the tweets posted by the opposition members of the National Assembly (2015-2017) in 
Venezuela for the time period between 1st to 31st January, 2019. The aim of this analysis is to identify the evolution of 
topics over time so that the results can be used to support the study of online censorship in the country. The underlying 
theory used to relate topic evolution with censorship proposes that decisions to block access to online platforms (like, 
Twitter) in non democratic regimes, depends on a difference between narrow and broad targets. The government is most likely 
to engage in censorship when the platform is functioning to create widespread negative attention focused on the government 
itself. Broader negative attention focused on the country as a whole, such as - economic collapse, food shortages, violence - 
is not likely to result in blocking of the platform. But if these discussions become linked to the government and are 
negatively discussed, then the possibility of censorship becomes higher. A structural topic model is used to empirically 
extract the topics and analyze how their prevalence change over time.
